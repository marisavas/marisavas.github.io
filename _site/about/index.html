                <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
                    <p>During my time as a <strong>Research Scientist at IBM Research Brazil</strong>, I had the opportunity to bridge theory and practice. I conducted advanced analyses of conversational agents (chatbots), improving user interactions, and exploring the impact of language and context on user experience. Additionally, I participated in Tech for Justice projects, analyzing the presence of underrepresented communities on social media , I also developed patents, including a method for auditing bias in AI systems. This experience deepened my understanding of systems and improved my skills in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>.</p><hr />
