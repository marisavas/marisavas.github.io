<a id="hiring"><b>Connecting Under Represented Minorities and Qualified Job Positions </b> (2021)</a>:
Explored the distribution of job postings among underrepresented groups, particularly Brazilian and U.S. Black Tech communities. Presented initial findings at the RDAI'21 workshop at AAAI, with further results published in WebSci'22.

At IBM Research Brazil, we focus on understanding the first phase of hiring process, how job posts are disseminated among underrepresented groups, in particular Brazilian black communities. Our initial proposal was presented in the RDAI'21 workshop at AAAI. My focus was on characterizing the Brazilian and US Black Tech communities as well as their perceptions about the big tech companies. The results were published at (WebSci'22).

<tr><td><a id="popularity"><b>Characterization and Popularity Prediction of Micro-Reviews</b> (2011-2015)</a>:

In the Ph.D. dissertation, an examination was conducted on user engagement with micro-reviews, particularly focusing on Foursquare tips, which present unique challenges due to their informal nature. Leveraging data from over 13 million Foursquare users, an analysis was carried out on the evolution of tip popularity over time, leading to the development of predictive models combining influencing factors. The study's key findings, including behavioral patterns impacting tip popularity, were published in WSDM'12, <a href="http://cosn.acm.org/2014/files/cosn089f-vasconcelosA.pdf">COSN'14</a>, and <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2554850.2554911">SAC'14</a>, with further investigation on tip popularity dynamics presented at COSN'14, and the overall research culminated in a publication in the Information Sciences journal in 2015.

<tr><td><a id="sentiment_analysis"><b>Polarity Detection in Micro-Reviews or Tips</b> (2012-2013)</a>:
The study assessed the effectiveness of polarity classification strategies on subsets of the Foursquare dataset, employing supervised machine learning techniques and an unsupervised lexicon-based approach. Findings indicate that effective polarity classification can be achieved, even with the simpler lexicon-based method, as outlined in the publication presented at the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marisa-Vasconcelos-2/publication/267025750_Polarity_Detection_of_Foursquare_Tips/links/544124670cf2a6a049a561d4/Polarity-Detection-of-Foursquare-Tips.pdf"> SocInfo'13</a> conference.

<!-- Personalized Recommendations Exploring Context Information (2010-2011)

We have proposed a model based on the Random Walk algorithm to recommend media objects (music tracks) exploring the users' profiles and the query context (music genre). We have evaluated our algorithms on a dataset collected from Last.fm that included information about users, the listened tracks, and the tags used. -->

<tr><td><a id="capacity"><b>Capacity Planning Models for Business Intelligence Workloads</b> (2009-2010)</a>:
In partnership with HP Labs, Palo Alto, our team tackled the development of analytical models for capacity planning and performance analysis in Business Intelligence workloads. These workloads, driven by queries processing large datasets, demanded intricate parallel processing solutions. Our efforts focused on optimizing intra-query pipeline parallelism to improve system efficiency and scalability.
