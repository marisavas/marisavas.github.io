    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Welcome! I'm Marisa Vasconcelos, a passionate researcher in the dynamic field of Artificial Intelligence. My journey has taken me across both academia and industry, where I've consistently pushed the boundaries of innovation in AI.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
    <ul class="key-achievements">
        <li><strong>Patented AI Fairness Tool</strong>: Developed and patented a solution for auditing and mitigating biases in AI models during my tenure at IBM Research Brazil.</li>
        <li><strong>Internationally Recognized Research</strong>: Published in top-tier conferences like ICWSM, The Web Conference, CHI, and Web Science.</li>
        <li><strong>Leader in Responsible AI</strong>: Led projects integrating Responsible AI into healthcare decision-making processes at CIIA-UFMG.</li>
        <li><strong>STEM Advocate</strong>: Co-created the WINDS (Women in Data Science) workshop to promote diversity in tech.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>My Research Focus</h3>
    <p>At the heart of my work is the intersection of technology and society. My research dives into <strong>Social Computing</strong> to uncover insights into human behavior and tackle critical issues like misinformation, hate speech, and cultural representation.</p>
    <p>I'm particularly passionate about the ethical dimensions of technology. In the realm of <strong>Responsible AI</strong>, I explore key topics like fairness, transparency, and governance, striving to ensure that AI solutions are not only innovative but also ethically sound.</p>
    
    <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
    <p>During my time as a <strong>Research Scientist at IBM Research Brazil</strong>, I had the opportunity to bridge theory and practice. I developed advanced tools for conversational agents (chatbots), enhancing user interactions, and exploring the impact of language and context on user experience. This work deepened my understanding of systems and honed my skills in <strong>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</strong>.</p>
    
    <h3>Academic Contributions</h3>
    <p>As a <strong>Postdoctoral Researcher at UFMG</strong>, my work focuses on applying best practices in Responsible AI. I'm currently involved in projects that assess AI models for ethical concerns, audit facial recognition software, and integrate Responsible AI into healthcare.</p>
    <p>My academic journey, enriched by collaborations with leading researchers and institutions, has given me a unique perspective on the ethical and practical challenges of AI. This has led to significant publications and contributions to the field.</p>
    
    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
    <p>I believe in the power of AI to solve complex problems and make a positive impact on society. With a strong foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of AI, I’m committed to developing solutions that are not only cutting-edge but also align with the highest ethical standards.</p>
    
    <p class="cta">Let's Collaborate</p>
    <p>If you're interested in pushing the boundaries of AI, whether in industry or academia, I'd love to connect! Let’s explore how we can work together to create innovative and responsible AI solutions.</p>
