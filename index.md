I am interested in exploring how data can be used to answer multidisciplinary research questions. My Ph.D. studies focused on large-scale studies on characterizing user behavior and predicting content popularity.
I am currently an IBM Research Staff Member in Sao Paulo, Brazil. I am interested in collaborating in projects related in either industry or academia, that are related to either social computing and computational social science, particularly project that involved social datasets.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in 2015. I worked under the supervision of Prof. Jussara Almeida and Prof. Virg√≠lio Almeida. Before that, I received my M.A. degree from Boston University, where my research was estimating the location of sensor networks. At that time, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Mark Crovella. Prior that time, I also received an M.Sc. and B.Sc. from Department of Computer Science at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in 2003 and 2000, respectively.

I am a recipient of a Fulbright award for my M.A. studies and I am also a recipient of Google Women in Technology (Anita Borg) award.
