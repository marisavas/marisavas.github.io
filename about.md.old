    <p style="position:absolute;top:180px;left:86px;line-height: 1.6;" class="about00">
      My name is Marisa Vasconcelos, and I am currently seeking new research opportunities in the dynamic field of Artificial Intelligence. With a robust background that spans both academia and the corporate world, I am well-prepared to make significant contributions to organizations and institutions that are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. My journey in Computer Science has been marked by a diverse array of research projects, each of which has enriched my knowledge and sharpened my skills. Starting from my undergraduate studies, I was deeply involved in research on information systems, with a keen focus on understanding system performance and addressing user needs.

      As I progressed to my doctoral studies, I immersed myself in the field of Social Computing, where I explored how the use of social media systems could impact performance, reveal vulnerabilities, and influence both individual and societal behaviors. This research culminated in my doctoral dissertation, which was my first major venture into the world of Artificial Intelligence, specifically focusing on predictive models for determining content popularity on social networks. The academic rigor and depth of this experience provided me with a strong theoretical foundation, which I have since built upon through significant publications and collaborations with leading researchers at international conferences.

    <p style="position:absolute;top:660px;left:86px;line-height: 1.6;" class="about00">
      In industry, I worked as a research scientist at IBM Research Brazil, where I had the opportunity to bridge theory with practical application. During this time, I developed tools for conversational agents, or chatbots, evaluating and enhancing user interactions, and explored the impact of language and contextual factors on the user experience. This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge of systems while acquiring and applying skills in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Additionally, I introduced discussions on fairness in AI models within the Brazilian team, which led to the development of a patented solution for auditing and mitigating biases, as well as a publication on AI ethics.

      Currently, as a postdoctoral researcher at UFMG continues, I am involved in projects focused on applying best practices in Responsible AI. This includes co-supervising a master's student on developing framework to evaluate AI models concerning ethical issues. Also, I participate in a facial recognition software audit project, and lead a project at the CIIA-UFMG (Center for Innovation in Artificial Intelligence for Health), which is focused on integrating Responsible AI into decision-making processes in the healthcare sector.

    <p style="position:absolute;top:1090px;left:86px;line-height: 1.6;" class="about00">
      These diverse experiences have given me a deep understanding of the immense potential of AI, not only for predictive modeling but also for understanding and influencing user behavior across various systems. My academic and professional journey, enriched by international experiences and collaborations, has equipped me with a unique perspective on the ethical and practical challenges of AI.
    </p>

    <p style="position:absolute;top:1250px;left:86px;line-height: 1.6;" class="about00">
      I am eager to apply my expertise to develop innovative AI solutions that are both efficient and ethically sound, contributing to projects that address complex problems and positively impact society.
