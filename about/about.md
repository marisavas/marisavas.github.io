      My name is Marisa Vasconcelos, and I am currently seeking new research opportunities in the dynamic field of Artificial Intelligence. With a robust background that spans both academia and the corporate world, I am well-prepared to make significant contributions to organizations and institutions that are dedicated to pushing the boundaries of AI innovation. My journey in Computer Science has been marked by a diverse array of research projects, each of which has enriched my knowledge and sharpened my skills. Starting from my undergraduate studies, I was deeply involved in research on information systems, with a keen focus on understanding system performance and addressing user needs.

      As I progressed to my doctoral studies, I immersed myself in the field of Social Computing, where I explored how the use of social media systems could impact performance, reveal vulnerabilities, and influence both individual and societal behaviors. This research culminated in my doctoral dissertation, which was my first major venture into the world of Artificial Intelligence, specifically focusing on predictive models for determining content popularity on social networks. The academic rigor and depth of this experience provided me with a strong theoretical foundation, which I have since built upon through significant publications and collaborations with leading researchers at international conferences.

      In industry, I worked as a research scientist at IBM Research Brazil, where I had the opportunity to bridge theory with practical application. During this time, I developed tools for conversational agents, or chatbots, evaluating and enhancing user interactions, and explored the impact of language and contextual factors on the user experience. This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge of systems while acquiring and applying skills in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI)
